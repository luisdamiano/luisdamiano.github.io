      <description>This is a quick, math-free summary of Deep Gaussian Processes by Damianou &amp;amp; Lawrence (2013). Many details are purposedly left out to lighten the read, see the full paper.
Disclaimer: As this is a first draft that has not been fully edited yet, watch out for errors, inaccuracies, and unfortunate choices of technical vocabulary. Let me know if you find any of these and I&amp;rsquo;ll get them fixed.
About the article  Main idea: introduce GP Gaussian Processes for learning tasks.</description>

      <description>Introduction They say [citation needed] that feature engineering is key for prediction and one should rather have a simple enough model fed with solid inputs. For instance, well-crafted nonlinear features could take the burden off nonlinear models. This is a rough and high-level list of the feature engineering strategies I&amp;rsquo;ve found. Mainly, I&amp;rsquo;m looking for when, pros, cons, recommendations, and warnings. Here definitions and explanations are intentionally omitted as they can be readily looked up on demand.</description>
